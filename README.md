# U6-JavaScript-Interacting-with-DOM

1.  About this Course - Along with selecting DOM elements in JavaScript we can also write code that gives elements behavior. In this course we will first explore how to watch for interaction and respond using the method addEventListener. We'll learn about different types of events and how we can use the relationships between elements to write more powerful code.
