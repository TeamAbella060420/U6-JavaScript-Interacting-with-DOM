# U6-JavaScript-Interacting-with-DOM

1.  About this Course - Along with selecting DOM elements in JavaScript we can also write code that gives elements behavior. In this course we will first explore how to watch for interaction and respond using the method addEventListener. We'll learn about different types of events and how we can use the relationships between elements to write more powerful code.
2. What is an Event? - One reason JavaScript is a powerful programming language is because it allows developers to respond to user interactions and changes in the browser. We can write JavaScript code to detect when different events occur and make changes to the browser in response.
